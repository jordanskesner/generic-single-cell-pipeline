## Major issue #1
installed salmon in conda env, has an issue finding a library called boost of the correct version
- installing with -c conda forge did not fix
- updating to ubuntu 20 from ubuntu 18 did not fix
- attempting to performa a manual install from github instad

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    git cmake g++ zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
    liblzma-dev libboost-all-dev libjemalloc-dev \
    libtbb-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

mkdir salmon
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon.git
cd salmon
mkdir build
cd build
## NOTE: make sure wget, curl, and unzip are installed or will get an error with fetchPufferfish.sh script
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
-did not work


trying to uninstall cmake version 4.0 and manually reinstall 3.5.2
(required OpenGl: sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev)
(also openssl libssl-dev)

--error in libstadenio
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev \
                 libbz2-dev build-essential git


cd cmake-3.5.2
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.5.2/cmake-3.5.2.tar.gz
tar -xvzf cmake-3.5.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.5.2
./bootstrap --prefix=$HOME/cmake-3.5.2
make -j$(nproc)
make install
echo 'export PATH=home/ubuntu1/cmake-3.5.2/cmake-3.5.2/bin/:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
cmake --version (to check correct version)
- now try to build salmon again
- did not work with version 3.5.2. installing 3.27 and try again

- in the end, build did not work either. used precompiled binaries to make it work


#### cellranger
after install, cellranger sitecheck failed with "cpu does not support avx instruction." may need to enable on the virtual machine
